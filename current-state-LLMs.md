### The Natural Language Processing (NLP) field is at the forefront of significant advancements.

This moment marks an ideal opportunity to delve into the realms of Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Artificial Intelligence (AI), 
as businesses, various tasks, institutions, and humanity at large are progressively integrating and engaging with AI technologies. 
The progress in Generative AI, encompassing both Large Language Models (LLM) and Large Vision Models (LVM), is particularly noteworthy.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP) encompasses a wide array of tasks that involve the interaction between computers and human language. Here are some of the key NLP tasks:

- [Text Classification]: Assigning categories or labels to text according to its content. This includes sentiment analysis, spam detection, and topic labeling.

- Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying named entities in text into predefined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.

- Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS): Assigning parts of speech to each word in a text (like nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) based on both its definition and its context.

- Chunking: Parsing text into "chunks" which are groups of words, typically noun phrases or verb phrases.

- Semantic Analysis: Understanding the meaning of text, including the relationships between words and the context in which they are used.

- Sentiment Analysis: Determining the emotional tone behind a series of words used to gain an understanding of the attitudes, opinions and emotions expressed within an online mention.

- Machine Translation: Automatically translating text from one language to another.

- Information Extraction: Automatically extracting structured information from unstructured text data. This can include extracting entities, relationships, and events.

- Question Answering: Building systems that automatically answer questions posed by humans in a natural language.

- Text Summarization: Automatically summarizing the key points or main ideas in a text.

- Speech Recognition: Converting spoken language into written text.

- Dialogue Systems/Chatbots: Building systems that can engage in a conversation with a human user.

- Natural Language Generation (NLG): Converting structured data or concepts into natural language.
- Coreference Resolution: Identifying when different words in a text refer to the same entity.
- Language Modeling: Predicting the next word or character in a sequence of words or characters.
- Dependency Parsing: Analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence, for example, identifying the dependencies between words.
- Text-to-Speech (TTS): Converting written text into spoken words.
